# LaTeX Matrix Generator

Web app build with React.js and react-bootstrap to help generate matrices in LaTeX. The LaTeX packages `amsmath` and `mathtools` are required to make the generated code work in your LaTeX project.

This was originally made in a day as a tool for helping me quickly take notes and do PSets for my linear algebra class, so it may not suit everyone and is a bit rough.
