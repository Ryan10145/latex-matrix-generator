# latex-matrix-generator

App to help generate matrices in LaTeX.

This was originally made as a tool for helping me quickly take notes and do psets for my linear algebra class, so it may not suit everyone. In the future, I may polish up the app a bit to make it more usable for the general public, but for now I don't have too many plans to expand this further.
